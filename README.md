# Datasets in "Protein pKa prediction by tree-based machine learning"

Here, we share the training/test datasets used in our paper entitled "Protein pKa prediction by tree-based machine learning" (https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/61ab7f78704d054ccb3ff895).

We also post our predicted pKa values for proteins in the human proteome from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database which are shown and discussed in the mentioned paper.
